# __FIX__ I have a terrible feeling that we are querying GameRow_Game everywhere however we wouldn't need all these
# props in every component (e.g. GameSearch)
fragment GameRow_Game on Game {
  id
  backgroundImage
  isInMaintenance
  logo
  name
  slug
  lobby {
    id
    tableId
    symbol
    provider
    results
    image
    type
    betBehind
    bets {
      min
      max
      symbol
    }
  }
  jackpot {
    id
    value {
      amount
      currency
    }
  }
}
